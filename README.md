### About Brackets

This project is a fork of an earlier version maintained by Adobe, with potential future name changes in store. 
We welcome contributions to help this fork achieve independenceâ€”feel free to submit a PR! For coordinating efforts, please visit our [Projects tab](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/projects/1?fullscreen=true).
<br><br>

### What sets Brackets apart?

- **Minimalist Approach:** Brackets' Quick Edit UI keeps your coding environment clean by integrating context-specific code and tools inline, rather than cluttering it with panels and icons.
  
- **Live Preview:** Stay in sync with your browser. Brackets works directly with your browser to instantly push code edits and switch seamlessly between your source code and browser view.
  
- **Open Source Customization:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, Brackets invites you to contribute to crafting the best web code editor. Learn more about how you can [get involved](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Brackets has hit version 1, but our journey continues with exciting feature ideas and innovative workflows for web development. Explore Brackets through [screenshots](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Screenshots), [intro videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/CodeBrackets), and updates on the [Brackets blog](http://blog.brackets.io/).
