Welcome to Brackets!
Brackets is a modern open-source code editor for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that's built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This is a fork of a project that has been maintained by the community. We might change names in the future.

A lot of work needs to be done to make this fork become independent. Feel free to open a PR! Want to help coordinate the project itself? Check the projects tab (here).

What makes Brackets different from other web code editors?

Tools shouldn't get in your way. Instead of cluttering up your coding environment with lots of panels and icons, the Quick Edit UI in Brackets puts context-specific code and tools inline.
Brackets is in sync with your browser. With Live Preview, Brackets works directly with your browser to push code edits instantly and jump back and forth between your real source code and the browser view.
Do it yourself. Because Brackets is open source, and built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you can help build the best code editor for the web.
Brackets may have reached version 1, but we're not stopping there. We have many feature ideas on our trello board that we're anxious to add and other innovative web development workflows that we're planning to build into Brackets. So take Brackets out for a spin and let us know how we can make it your favorite editor.

You can see some screenshots of Brackets on the wiki, intro videos on YouTube, and news on the Brackets blog.

How to install and run Brackets
Download
Installers for the latest stable build for Mac and Windows can be downloaded here.

Usage
By default, Brackets opens a folder containing some simple "Getting Started" content. You can choose a different folder to edit using File > Open Folder.

Most of Brackets should be pretty self-explanatory, but for information on how to use its unique features, like Quick Edit and Live Preview, please read How to Use Brackets. Also, see the release notes for a list of new features and known issues in each build.

In addition to the core features built into Brackets, there is a large and growing community of developers building extensions that add all sorts of useful functionality. See the Brackets Extension Registry for a list of available extensions. For installation instructions, see the extensions wiki page.

Helping Brackets
I found a bug!
If you found a repeatable bug, and troubleshooting tips didn't help, then be sure to search existing issues first. Include steps to consistently reproduce the problem, actual vs. expected results, screenshots, and your OS and Brackets version number. Disable all extensions to verify the issue is a core Brackets bug. Read more guidelines for filing good bugs.

I have a new suggestion, but don't know how to program!
For feature requests, please first check our Trello board to see if it's already there; you can upvote it if so. If not, feel free to file it as an issue as above; we'll move it to the feature backlog for you.

I want to help with the code!
Awesome! There are lots of ways you can help. First read CONTRIBUTING.md, then learn how to pull the repo and hack on Brackets.

The text editor inside Brackets is based on CodeMirrorâ€”thanks to Marijn for taking our pull requests, implementing feature requests, and fixing bugs! See Notes on CodeMirror for info on how we're using CodeMirror.

Although Brackets is built in HTML/CSS/JS, it currently runs as a desktop application in a thin native shell, so that it can access your local files. (If you just try to open the index.html file in a browser, it won't work yet.) The native shell for Brackets lives in a separate repo, brackets-cont/brackets-shell.

I want to keep track of how Brackets is doing!
Not sure you needed the exclamation point there, but we like your enthusiasm.

What's Brackets working on next?
In our feature backlog, the columns to the right (starting from "Development") list the features that we're currently working on. "Ready" shows what we'll be working on next.
Watch our GitHub activity stream.
The entire development process is outlined in the Developer Guide.
