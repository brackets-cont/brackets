Everyscrub for Brackets
=======================
> **Note: Shortcuts & modifiers changed recently** to avoid clashing with the "multiple cursors" functionality in Brackets Sprint 38.

Everything's a scrubber! Alt/⌥ + drag on any number or hex color to scrub its value. In "Live Development" mode, the browser
preview will update in real time while you're dragging.

You can also tap Ctrl/⌘+Alt + Up/Down to "nudge" the value in individual increments.

Scrubbing a hex color darkens/lightens the color. Like numbers, this works in any file type (not just CSS, JS, etc.).
